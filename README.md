# EOS security standards

The main goals of this repo are:

- provide guidelines of developing EOS smart-contracts securely and making them as fault-tolerant as possible

- provide guidelines of launching a DApp project following the necessary procedures to minimize a risk of a hack or other software exploits

- preserve the history of hacks that have already happened and the conclusions from these incidents
